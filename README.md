# Happy Web

Application developed during the Next Level Week #3 ([Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) :rocket:). Happy is an application that allows orphanages to sign up adding their info, such as their address and visiting hours, and users to search the map for the orphanage's addresses. Developed using React.js and Typescript.
